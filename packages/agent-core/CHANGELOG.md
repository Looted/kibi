# kibi-agent-core

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f8fff87: The telemetry acceptance and remediation reports now show whether agents look requirements up before they change requirement-linked code. A new `lookup_before_first_edit` metric gives, per host session, the share of sessions that ran `kb_search` or `kb_query` (through MCP or the CLI) before their first edit of a file whose symbols implement a requirement. Sessions that edited first appear in the report with the file and its exact `.kb/usage.log` line. The data comes from opt-in hook rows that every Kibi host plugin now writes when `KIBI_DIAGNOSTIC_MODE` is set; nothing is recorded otherwise.

  - `kibi usage-metrics` / `kb_check` telemetry acceptance: new metric `lookup_before_first_edit` (threshold `>=` policy `lookupBeforeFirstEditMinimum`, default 1) with evidence `unguidedEditPaths` and `lookupOperations`. It is `not_applicable` when no host hook recorded a requirement-linked edit, so logs without hook rows are judged as before. A failed metric adds the advisory diagnostic `lookup_before_first_edit_bypassed` (rank 35).
  - `kibi usage-remediation`: one event item per session whose first linked edit had no earlier lookup, pointing at that hook row.
  - `parseTelemetryUsageLog` still returns only Kibi operation rows; hook rows stay attached to the returned array (read them with `partitionTelemetryUsage`). Remediation `logLine` values now count hook rows and blank lines, so they match the file.
  - `kibi-agent-core/hook-usage-log`: shared `appendHookUsage` / `appendHookUsageRows`, `kbUsageTrace` and `editTraces`. Hook rows (`interface: "hook"`) carry `host`, `session_id`, `hook_action` (`kb_usage` or `edited`), `kb_operation`, `path`, `path_kind` and `requirement_ids`. `hostKbOperation` recognizes MCP tool names and `kibi <route>` shell commands; `extractEditedPaths` reads `apply_patch` headers.
  - Claude Code: `edited` rows now carry the file's `requirement_ids`, and every row names its `host`. Cursor (`postToolUse`), Codex and ZCode (`PostToolUse`) and OpenCode (`tool.execute.after`) now write the same `kb_usage` and `edited` rows.

- 1012d1c: When an agent edits a file that implements a requirement, every Kibi host plugin (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, ZCode and OpenCode) now says what that requirement must keep true and the decision behind it, not just its ID. The extra lines come from the requirement's linked facts and ADR, so agents see the constraint before they change the code. All hosts build the snippet with one shared builder in `kibi-agent-core`, so they show the same lines within each host's size limits, and none of them presents a superseded or retired requirement as current.

  - New `kibi-agent-core/snippets` export: `fileKnowledgeSnippet`, `requirementGroundingLines`, `editKnowledgeContext`, `editFocus` and `createEntitySummarizer`. Edit snippets add "`<REQ>` must keep true: …" (up to two facts linked via `constrains`, `requires_property`, `requires_predicate` or `requires_rule`) and "Decision: `<ADR>`" for the lead requirement. Read snippets keep the requirement and test lines only.
  - A superseded, deprecated or retired lead requirement gets no "must keep true" or "Decision" lines, so retired policy is not shown as current.
  - Claude Code: the `PreToolUse` edit snippet now comes from the shared builder (no change in content).
  - Cursor: `preToolUse` edit guidance and `beforeReadFile` / read guidance include the shared snippet for files whose symbols implement a requirement, followed by the existing "query before you change it" follow-up.
  - Codex: `PreToolUse` on `apply_patch` (and other edit tools) returns the snippet as `additionalContext`, for up to three changed files per call and once per file per session. Paths come from the patch's `*** Update/Add/Delete File:` headers.
  - ZCode: `PreToolUse` on edit tools returns the snippet as `additionalContext`, including "The edit is inside `<symbol>`" when the edited text is found, once per file per session.
  - OpenCode: the edit-guidance system prompt adds one "must keep true … Decision …" bullet (one fact) for the focus file, within the existing word budget.
  - `readEntitySummary` returns frontmatter `links` (plain entries read as `relates_to`; `type` and `target` in either order) merged with the entity's records in `.kb/relationships` shards, so grounding stored only in shards still reaches the snippet.
  - Session and discovery hints point at `kb_search` questions and its answer layer instead of asking for `rankingMode: "intent-v1"`, which is now the default.

### Patch Changes

- 15356de: Host hooks no longer ask for a `kb_check` after a `kb_upsert` dry run. A dry run only validates, so the Cursor, Codex, ZCode and OpenCode hooks now count it as validation rather than a KB write.

  - `extractKbMcpToolCall` reports `kb_upsert` with `dryRun: true` as `kb_validate_upsert`.
  - OpenCode's freshness evidence records a dry-run upsert as `kb_validate_upsert`, which carries no mutation evidence.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 676bac9: The Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and ZCode plugins now tell the Kibi MCP server which workspace each call is about, so sessions working in a git worktree are answered from that worktree's branch instead of the checkout the server started in. Nothing changes for sessions that stay in one project.
  - Each plugin's pre-tool hook adds `workspaceRoot`, the agent's current Kibi workspace, to every Kibi MCP call. Claude Code, Cursor, and ZCode send it without a permission decision so the host's own approval flow is unchanged; Codex requires `permissionDecision: "allow"` for input rewrites, which does not override a server's tool approval mode.
  - `kibi-agent-core` exports `KIBI_WORKSPACE_ARGUMENT`, `isKibiMcpToolName`, and `stampKibiWorkspace` for the plugins.
  - The Codex hook parser now reads `hook_event_name`, the field Codex actually sends; the Claude and ZCode `PreToolUse` matchers include `mcp__.*__kb_.*`.
  - The ZCode launcher sets `KIBI_MCP_HOST=zcode` so its usage rows are attributed like the other hosts'.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 5a06c03: Kibi's agent plugins now share one fast, consistent implementation for source-path classification, Kibi MCP tool recognition, and symbol-manifest indexing. Codex and ZCode now recognize production code outside `src/`, while Cursor reuses the same size-and-mtime-keyed scanner as Claude instead of parsing the full symbol manifest before an edit.
  - Add `kibi-agent-core` as the common Node 18-compatible hook-helper package.
  - Keep host adapters thin while preserving their host-specific event and state contracts.
  - Replace Cursor's YAML parser dependency with the shared cached line scanner.

## 0.0.0

- Initial shared hook-helper package.
