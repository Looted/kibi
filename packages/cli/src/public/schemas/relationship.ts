 How to apply this header to source files (examples)

 1) Prepend header to a single file (POSIX shells):

    cat LICENSE_HEADER.txt "$FILE" > "$FILE".with-header && mv "$FILE".with-header "$FILE"

 2) Apply to multiple files (example: the project's main entry files):

    for f in packages/cli/bin/kibi packages/mcp/bin/kibi-mcp packages/cli/src/*.ts packages/mcp/src/*.ts; do
      if [ -f "$f" ]; then
        cp "$f" "$f".bak
        (cat LICENSE_HEADER.txt; echo; cat "$f" ) > "$f".new && mv "$f".new "$f"
      fi
    done

 3) Avoid duplicating the header: run a quick guard to only add if missing

    for f in packages/cli/bin/kibi packages/mcp/bin/kibi-mcp; do
      if [ -f "$f" ]; then
        if ! head -n 5 "$f" | grep -q "Copyright (C) 2026 Piotr Franczyk"; then
          cp "$f" "$f".bak
          (cat LICENSE_HEADER.txt; echo; cat "$f" ) > "$f".new && mv "$f".new "$f"
        fi
      fi
    done

 Notes:
 - Apply the header to the source files (TS/JS/other) in `packages/*/src` before building.
 - For small CLI wrapper scripts (e.g. `packages/*/bin/*`) you can add the header as a block comment directly above the shebang line or below it; if you need the shebang to remain the very first line, place the header after the shebang.
 - Built `dist/` files are generated; prefer to modify source files and rebuild rather than editing `dist/` directly.
