## 0.7.5

### Patch Changes

- 6315e95: Bootstrap no longer fills the knowledge base with content-free provider facts. A discovered provider entry whose source states no claim (a source module, a package manifest, a layout root, a test file with no recognized framework) is now a provenance stub: written as `fact_kind: meta` tagged `bootstrap:provenance-stub`, planned after every candidate with a claim, counted apart in the plan, ranked after everything else by `kb_search` (and dropped below its default threshold), never listed as a note in the search answer, and not counted as knowledge by `kb_find_gaps` or `kb_coverage`. On a test project, raising `maxCandidates` to 200 had added 150 such stubs, which then surfaced in search answers; the `over_limit` diagnostic now says how many suppressed candidates are stubs so an operator does not raise the limit for them.

  Technical summary: `providerCandidate` classifies a provider candidate by `data.claim`; `test_topology` sets a claim when it recognizes a framework (and stays an observation), while `source_symbols`, `repo_metadata` and `repo_layout` never do (stubs, `provenanceStubBody`). `selectBootstrapCandidates` puts stubs in a last lane, marks `over_limit` rows with `provenanceStub` and counts them in the diagnostic; `presentBootstrap` adds `candidatesWithClaims`, `provenanceStubs` and `suppressedProvenanceStubs` to `discoverySummary` and reports the stub share in `tldr`. The shared `provenance-stub.ts` helper drives the intent-v1 and legacy rankings (`demoted: provenance stub`, sorted last, intent score times 0.25) and the answer layer; `discovery.pl` skips stubs in `find_gaps_json` unless the tag is requested and reports them as `summary.provenanceStubs` in type coverage. The kibi-bootstrap skill (3.9.0) tells agents not to raise the cap for stubs.

- 6315e95: `kb_model` mode `predicates` no longer lets an actor, role or owner be bound to the requirement's subject key. Binding hints offered the subject key for any naming argument, so an agent bound `actor = <subject key>` on a `permission_rule` and got a complete predicate whose actor said nothing the fact's `subject_key` did not already say. Subject keys are now offered only for the `subject` argument and for `entity` arguments; an explicit participant binding equal to a constrained subject key stays unbound with a reason, and when the claim names no participant the hint says so and points to `record_ontology_gap`.

  Technical summary: `predicate-bindings.ts` adds `isParticipantArgumentType` (`actor`, `actor_scope`, `role`, `owner`) and `subjectKeyParticipantReason`, which `classifyBinding` applies to explicit and extracted values through the new `constrainedSubjects` binding context that `buildSuggestion` now passes; the hinted-first-argument shortcut no longer applies to a participant-typed first argument. `buildBindingHints` restricts subject-key examples to `subject` and `entity` arguments and replaces the "or the requirement's subject key" advice with no-participant guidance for participant arguments. `replacementPlan` (K20) now carries `expected.kbCheckAfterStep` listing both `logic-coverage` and `strict-req-fact-pairing` between the retraction and the link, `kbCheckAfterLastStep: []` and `rollbackWhen`, and its instructions and rollback reason state the rollback condition as a `kb_check` that is not clean after the last step. The kibi-usage skill (2.10.0) describes both.

## 0.7.4

### Patch Changes

- 89d8b8e: `kb_model` mode `predicates` no longer offers a predicate plan that `kb_check` would then reject. The requirement's subject now binds the argument a schema names `subject` wherever it sits, and for a schema without one (such as `permission_rule`) it is recorded as the planned predicate fact's `subject_key`; a predicate that is not about a subject the requirement constrains stays `provide_argument_bindings` with a hint instead of `replace_grounding` or `apply_requires_predicate`. A value taken from the claim for an actor, resource or other participant that is a long clause (more than three words) is no longer accepted as a binding.

  Technical summary: `buildSuggestion` binds `subjectHint` or the single constrained subject into `argument_names.indexOf("subject")` and adds `subject_key` and `subject_pairing` (`paired`, `unpaired`, `not_required`) to each candidate; an unpaired candidate gets `subject` or `subject_key` in `unbound_arguments`, a `bindingHints` entry (position -1 for `subject_key`) and a warning naming the schema. `buildPredicateApplyPlan` writes `subject_key` on the planned fact when it is known, so `replacementPlan` step 1 carries it. `classifyBinding` treats an extracted value of an `entity`, `actor`, `actor_scope`, `resource`, `owner`, `role` or `component` argument with more than three snake-case words as a placeholder (`clauseBindingReason`), and the hint says why. The constrained subjects are now read even when `subjectHint` is passed. The kibi-usage skill (2.9.0) describes `subject_key` and short participant bindings.

## 0.7.3

### Patch Changes

- c9dd5f9: Bootstrap plans now write one subject fact per subject key. When claims from different sources (a handoff document and a ticket, say) name the same subject, every requirement links to that one fact instead of each getting its own copy, so `kb_check` no longer reports `subject-key-identity` right after an applied bootstrap and nobody has to merge the facts by hand. The plan lists each shared key in a `subject-key-shared:` diagnostic naming its sources.

  Technical summary: after candidate selection `kb_plan_bootstrap` keeps the first selected subject fact for each `subject_key`, drops the later ones, retargets their requirements' `constrains` links (and the candidates' `relationships`) to the kept fact, and adds every source's `provenance:` tag and a `document.body` listing the sources to it. The transformation depends only on the candidate order, so `planHash` stays deterministic; action `dependsOn` follows the retargeted links. The kibi-bootstrap skill (3.8.0) and `docs/mcp-reference.md` describe the diagnostic.

- c9dd5f9: `kb_model` mode `predicates` now takes the predicate's subject from the requirement: when `requirementId` names a requirement that constrains a subject fact, the predicate uses that fact's `subject_key`, so the predicate and the subject fact name one subject and contradiction checks see them together. Demo guesses such as `editor.annotation` are no longer applied to a requirement; a requirement without a subject fact leaves `subject` for the agent to bind. `docs/mcp-reference.md` now says that `structuredContent.<field>` paths are shorthand for `structuredContent.data.<field>` inside the protocol envelope.

  Technical summary: `handleKbSuggestPredicates` reads the `subject_key` of every subject fact the requirement `constrains`. With exactly one, it binds the schema's `subject` argument with the new binding provenance `requirement` (applicable like `explicit`); with several, they come first in the subject's `bindingHints[].examples`. `subjectHint` and an explicit `argumentBindings.subject` still win. `inferSubject` takes the requirement context and keeps its keyword heuristics for free text without `requirementId`. The kibi-usage skill (2.8.0) names the `structuredContent.data.bindingHints` path and the requirement-bound subject.

## 0.7.2

### Patch Changes

- 5aab5a2: Bootstrap plans no longer turn a whole clause into a subject key. A key such as `support_inbox.update_in_real_time_when_a_new_ticket_is_assigned_to_the_agent_without_a_page_refresh` is now planned as `support_inbox.update_in_real_time`, and the plan diagnostics name the original key so the operator can pick a better name before approving. Two different subjects that would share a shortened key get distinct keys instead of colliding.

  An aspect longer than four words or 40 characters is shortened deterministically: the words before the first clause boundary (`when`, `while`, `for`, `and`, ...) without leading or trailing stop words, then, if still too long, its content words, then the first and last two content words. Each shortening adds a `subject-key-shortened:` diagnostic; a collision between different subjects adds a third segment from the later claim's wording (or a short digest) and a `subject-key-disambiguated:` diagnostic, while claims about the same subject keep sharing one key. One registry per plan covers repository Markdown and declared intent claims. The kibi-bootstrap skill (3.7.0) and `docs/mcp-reference.md` explain how components are supplied and how aspects are derived.

- 5aab5a2: `kb_model` mode `predicates` no longer accepts argument bindings that only repeat a field name, such as `before_event: "before_event"`, or a bare stop word such as `action: "be"`. Those values used to complete a predicate and produce a write plan for a meaningless fact; the argument now stays unbound. When bindings are missing, the response lists each unbound argument with its type and example values so agents can bind from the claim text instead of guessing.

  `classifyBinding` treats a value equal to its own or another argument name (after snake-case normalization) as a placeholder unless the claim itself names it, and treats trivial verbs, articles and filler words as placeholders; `true`, `false`, the schema's declared `argument_constants` and a subject given through `subjectHint` are still accepted. On `provide_argument_bindings`, `structuredContent.bindingHints` gives `argument`, `position`, `type`, optional `description`, `allowedValues` for a closed vocabulary, `examples` from the constants and the schema's examples, the refused `currentValue` with its `provenance`, and a `reason`; the text summary lists them too. The kibi-usage skill (2.7.0) and `docs/mcp-reference.md` describe the rule.

- 5aab5a2: The ontology-gap observation that `kb_model` mode `predicates` returns can now be written with `kb_upsert` exactly as returned. Before, every such plan was rejected because it linked the observation to the `review:ontology-gap` tag as if the tag were an entity, and it carried a `claim_key` that made a review note look like a semantic claim. The `replace_grounding` plan is now also directly applicable: its requirement step restates the stored title, status and tags, and the response says why the steps must run in order.

  The gap observation keeps `claim_text`, `value_string` and `text_ref`, drops `claim_key` and the tag relationship, and adds a `document.body` saying that no predicate schema fits and quoting the claim, so schema 8's `entity-context-missing` passes. Semantic-advisor review observations (`review:ambiguity`, `review:keyword-false-positive`, `review:ontology-gap`, `review:nonlogical`) likewise keep their category in `tags` only and carry a body. `replacementPlan` adds a `rollback` step that restores the retracted link if the last step fails, and its instructions note that `kb_check` reports `logic-coverage` between the retraction and the new link. A new MCP stdio test applies both plans through the real server. The kibi-usage skill (2.7.0) and `docs/mcp-reference.md` describe the shapes, and `docs/mcp-reference.md` and `docs/error-reference.md` explain that the `rdf/lock` left after a session belongs to the shared engine daemon, which exits after 10 idle minutes.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- be5d25e: Bootstrap plans no longer write subject keys that Kibi's own `subject-key-shape` rule flags. Declare the component a knowledge source or an intent claim is about (`component: "recorder"`) and the plan uses keys such as `recorder.beginning_to_record_while_idle`; a claim Kibi cannot place is reported in the plan diagnostics and left as an authoring follow-up instead. Intent claims can also carry the `rationale` the source or the human gave, which becomes the requirement's `rationale` and `## Context`.

  `bootstrapContext.knowledgeSources[].component`, `intentClaims[].component` and `intentClaims[].rationale` are new optional fields bound into the plan hash only when declared. Subject keys keep an already dotted subject, use a one-word subject as the component with the constrained property as the aspect, and otherwise prefix the declared component; repository Markdown takes its component from the file or directory name. The kibi-bootstrap skill (3.6.0) asks the human for the reason behind a requirement whose source states none, and sets scenario `expects` only when the scenario links `assumes` facts, so draft scenarios tagged `needs-human-review` no longer raise `scenario-feasibility-unknown`. The kibi-usage skill (2.6.0) and `docs/modeling-cheatsheet.md` match.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 393f492: Large bootstrap plans no longer fall over when they take longer than the agent's MCP client is willing to wait. `kb_apply_plan` reports progress after every bootstrap action, so clients that reset their timeout on progress keep waiting, and `async: true` returns a `kibi.job.v1` receipt to poll with `kb_job_status` instead of holding the request open. If an apply is still cut off mid-action, `kb_apply_plan` with the journal's `recoveryJournalId` resumes it without hand-editing the journal and reclaims a source lock left behind by the dead process.

  `OperationContext` and `RuntimeOptions` gain an optional `onProgress` reporter (`OperationProgress`, `ProgressReporter` are exported from `kibi-runtime`). The bootstrap executor reports after each applied action; the MCP server forwards reports as `notifications/progress` when the request carries `_meta.progressToken`, and each report also pushes back the server's `KIBI_MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MS`, which then bounds inactivity rather than the whole apply. `kb_apply_plan` accepts `async` (MCP only; it falls back to a synchronous apply when `kb_job_status` is not enabled) and its output contract admits the job receipt. Bootstrap recovery now accepts drift since the last checkpoint only when the journal is still `applying` with an active action that has no result: that action is re-applied, the result notes it, and the journal records it under `interruptedActions`; any other drift is still refused. `acquireWorkspaceMutationLock` takes a `reclaimDeadHolder` option; `kb_apply_plan` grants it only for a bootstrap recovery whose journal is `applying`, moves a dead holder's lock aside atomically, records it under `lockReclaims` in the journal, and keeps failing closed for live, unverifiable, corrupt or legacy owners. Bundled skills `kibi-bootstrap` 3.5.0 and `kibi-usage` 2.5.0 describe progress, async apply and journal recovery, and say never to edit `.kb/recovery`.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- b350869: Requirements, scenarios, tests, ADRs and observations now have to say why they exist. `kibi check` blocks a current entity whose body has no real context, `kb_compile_intent` requires a `context` for a new requirement, and bootstrap keeps the quoted source excerpt in the entity instead of only on the approval screen. Existing knowledge bases upgrade to schema 8 with `kibi migrate --yes`, which keeps every body byte-identical and only tags entities that lack context `review:context-missing`, recording their ids in `.kb/manifest.json`; the tag is honored only for those ids, so an agent cannot clear the check by tagging an entity itself. Run `kibi sync` afterwards.

  Entity bodies are split into sections by Markdown headings; `Context`, `Rationale`, `Why`, `Background`, `Source`, `Notes` and `Evidence` headings count as context. A requirement counts only context headings, while scenarios, tests, ADRs and observation or meta facts count all prose. Context needs at least 12 words and a token-set Jaccard similarity below 0.8 against the title (and, for a requirement, `semantic_text`); symbols, flags, events and other fact kinds are exempt. New canonical rule `entity-context-missing` and advisory `entity-context-acknowledged` are registered, and `kb_upsert` (including dryRun) warns about the same finding. `requirementSemanticText` now excludes context sections, and every requirement authoring path writes `semantic_text` explicitly; the schema 8 migration pins it for existing requirements with the previous derivation so claim spans and hashes do not move. `kb_compile_intent` gains `context`, `sourceExcerpt` and `sourceReference` and renders statement, `## Context` and `## Source`; on update it replaces the statement and keeps the existing context sections byte for byte unless new context or source is supplied. `kb_plan_bootstrap` requires `excerpt` for `intent` and `observation` claims and persists it with the source title and reference in the created body. Search snippets come from the first context prose. Bundled skills `kibi-usage` 2.4.0 and `kibi-bootstrap` 3.4.0 document the per-type body contract and say never to invent a reason.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 7f08632: Bootstrap no longer drops conditional claims ("If microphone access fails, the editor must ...") or obligations that mention a referent ("... any draft state that refers to it") as `invalid_write`; they become ready requirement candidates. Linking a scenario to an existing requirement with `kb_upsert` no longer requires resending its whole semantic inventory, and a review observation can quote the claim it is about without a `claim_key`. The bundled skills now show how to answer `provide_argument_bindings` from `kb_model` predicates and how to write scenarios from acceptance criteria.

  Technical summary: requirement steps built by `kb_plan_bootstrap`, the `kb_model` requirement path and typed logic plans take each inventory role from the semantic advisor (`advisorPropositionRole`), so the write-time proposition-complete check accepts what Kibi itself generated. The advisor classifies a clause as `definition` only when "means / is defined as / refers to / is called" is the main predicate of a sentence that asserts no obligation; inventories stored with the earlier `definition` role for such clauses still validate. `kb_upsert` on an existing `req` whose payload carries no `semantic_*` or `logic_claims` field and keeps the stored `title` and `text_ref` merges the stored ledger (and the stored `text_ref` when the payload omits it) before validation and writing; a payload that supplies ledger fields or changes the prose is checked as sent. The entity schema, the `kb_upsert` input schema and the Prolog shape check now let an `observation` or `meta` fact carry `claim_text` without `claim_key`; every other fact still needs both. `kibi-usage` 2.3.2 adds a predicate-binding retry example and a review observation payload; `kibi-bootstrap` 3.3.1 makes step 11 write scenarios from acceptance criteria with `assumes` links.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 44b2d0d: After bootstrap, agents now keep going instead of stopping at a knowledge base that holds only cited requirements. Previously the `kibi-bootstrap` skill ended with "hand off to the normal Kibi workflow" and no instructions, and its rule against direct `kb_upsert` left claims the plan could not write with no way to author them. Now a "deepen" step tells the agent what to author next, in the normal workflow and with the human informed.

  The bundled `kibi-bootstrap` skill is now 3.3.0. A new step 11 ("Deepen") runs after apply and close-out. It loads `kibi-usage` and hands every claim suppressed as `invalid_write` or listed in `sourceOnlySignals` to `kb_model` and `kb_upsert` with its statement and `sourceId:reference` citation. It proposes a scenario from acceptance criteria (`specified_by`) for each persisted requirement, runs `kb_model` with `mode: "predicates"` on each one, and records any undeclared conflict or open question as a `review:conflict` or `review:open-question` observation. The safety boundary now states that the direct-`kb_upsert` prohibition covers the bootstrap plan's own writes, not this post-bootstrap authoring. Step 5 sends unplanned claims to step 11, and the report step is renumbered 12.

### Patch Changes

- ec26130: Bootstrap now keeps what the onboarding interview leaves unsettled. Previously every declared claim was treated as intended behavior, and contradictions between sources or open questions had no place in the plan, so they stayed in the agent's own notes and were lost after apply. Now a claim can be marked as an observation or an open question, and conflicts between claims can be declared. Each is kept in the KB as a cited review fact instead of becoming a requirement.

  `kb_plan_bootstrap` accepts `bootstrapContext.intentClaims[].kind` (`intent` by default, `observation`, `open_question`) and `bootstrapContext.conflicts[]` (`claimReferences` of two to ten `{ sourceId, reference }` pairs plus a `note`). Observation and open-question claims become `fact_kind: observation` candidates with the claim's citation evidence and `text_ref: <sourceId>:<reference>`; open questions are tagged `review:open-question`. Each conflict becomes a `fact_kind: observation` candidate tagged `review:conflict` that cites every referenced claim; a conflict naming an undeclared claim is reported in `diagnostics`. Kinds and conflicts are part of `declaredContext` and the plan hash (the default `intent` kind is omitted, so existing plans keep their hash), and the facts go through the same plan-time write validation as every other candidate. The `kibi-bootstrap` skill (3.2.3) updates the harvest, declare and approval steps.

- 094fcae: Bootstrap now links your declared intent to the code even when you declare many claims. Previously declared intent claims used up the shared `maxCandidates` budget, so with 50 or more claims every symbol, test and repository document Kibi found was suppressed as `over_limit`, and the plan to approve listed hundreds of suppression rows. Now claims sit outside the budget, generic Markdown stays out of claim-driven plans unless you ask for it, and suppressions are summarized as one count per reason.

  `kb_plan_bootstrap` applies `maxCandidates` (default 50) only to discovered candidates, independent of how many declared `intentClaims` are planned, and reports one `N discovered candidate(s) exceeded maxCandidates` diagnostic instead of the old "discovered candidates get no slots" note. `includeGenericMarkdown` defaults to `false` when `bootstrapContext` declares `intentClaims` (a diagnostic states it) and to `true` otherwise; an explicit value always wins, and the input schema no longer advertises a fixed default. `tldr` and a new `Suppressed candidates by reason` diagnostic aggregate `suppressedCandidates` per reason; the full rows are unchanged. The `kibi-bootstrap` skill (3.2.2) updates step 5 accordingly.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 564b171: Bootstrap plans no longer drop the intent claims you declared from tracker, wiki or spec sources when the repository has many candidates. Previously the default 50-candidate cap could silently discard every claim from one source, and two markdown lines that restated one rule could leave an approved plan half-applied. Now every declared claim is planned, each source reports how many of its claims were planned, and a plan that plans none of an authoritative source's claims asks for context instead of reporting ready.

  `kb_plan_bootstrap` applies `maxCandidates` only to discovered candidates. Candidates that would rewrite an already-planned entity with different content are suppressed as `duplicate_entity`, and the write-time `claim_key` grounding check now also runs at plan time against planned writes, suppressing mismatches as `invalid_write`. The plan adds one `Knowledge source …` diagnostic per declared source. The `kibi-bootstrap` skill (3.2.1) tells agents to read those diagnostics and no longer advises against `maxCandidates`.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Agents now pick up the `kibi-bootstrap` skill for onboarding work beyond seeding a new knowledge base: reviewing a plan or preview, judging approval readiness, diagnosing a blocked or failed bootstrap, and applying an approved plan. The skill starts every task with `kb_status`, routes review and repair tasks to a read-only preview, and checks before applying that the plan matches the approved one field for field, including `suppressedCandidates`. In paired SkillOpt runs, 10 cells per variant, the new skill scored 95 against 70 for the previous one. It applied approved plans that the previous skill failed to apply, and it had no security failures where the previous skill had two.

  Skill `kibi-bootstrap` 3.2.0 rewrites the frontmatter `description` and the body. Every other frontmatter field and every resource stays the same. The candidate was drafted, evaluated and confirmed on a fresh cohort with the SkillOpt campaign workflow, using the Claude Code target host.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- f8fff87: The telemetry acceptance and remediation reports now show whether agents look requirements up before they change requirement-linked code. A new `lookup_before_first_edit` metric gives, per host session, the share of sessions that ran `kb_search` or `kb_query` (through MCP or the CLI) before their first edit of a file whose symbols implement a requirement. Sessions that edited first appear in the report with the file and its exact `.kb/usage.log` line. The data comes from opt-in hook rows that every Kibi host plugin now writes when `KIBI_DIAGNOSTIC_MODE` is set; nothing is recorded otherwise.
  - `kibi usage-metrics` / `kb_check` telemetry acceptance: new metric `lookup_before_first_edit` (threshold `>=` policy `lookupBeforeFirstEditMinimum`, default 1) with evidence `unguidedEditPaths` and `lookupOperations`. It is `not_applicable` when no host hook recorded a requirement-linked edit, so logs without hook rows are judged as before. A failed metric adds the advisory diagnostic `lookup_before_first_edit_bypassed` (rank 35).
  - `kibi usage-remediation`: one event item per session whose first linked edit had no earlier lookup, pointing at that hook row.
  - `parseTelemetryUsageLog` still returns only Kibi operation rows; hook rows stay attached to the returned array (read them with `partitionTelemetryUsage`). Remediation `logLine` values now count hook rows and blank lines, so they match the file.
  - `kibi-agent-core/hook-usage-log`: shared `appendHookUsage` / `appendHookUsageRows`, `kbUsageTrace` and `editTraces`. Hook rows (`interface: "hook"`) carry `host`, `session_id`, `hook_action` (`kb_usage` or `edited`), `kb_operation`, `path`, `path_kind` and `requirement_ids`. `hostKbOperation` recognizes MCP tool names and `kibi <route>` shell commands; `extractEditedPaths` reads `apply_patch` headers.
  - Claude Code: `edited` rows now carry the file's `requirement_ids`, and every row names its `host`. Cursor (`postToolUse`), Codex and ZCode (`PostToolUse`) and OpenCode (`tool.execute.after`) now write the same `kb_usage` and `edited` rows.

- 1012d1c: When an agent edits a file that implements a requirement, every Kibi host plugin (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, ZCode and OpenCode) now says what that requirement must keep true and the decision behind it, not just its ID. The extra lines come from the requirement's linked facts and ADR, so agents see the constraint before they change the code. All hosts build the snippet with one shared builder in `kibi-agent-core`, so they show the same lines within each host's size limits, and none of them presents a superseded or retired requirement as current.
  - New `kibi-agent-core/snippets` export: `fileKnowledgeSnippet`, `requirementGroundingLines`, `editKnowledgeContext`, `editFocus` and `createEntitySummarizer`. Edit snippets add "`<REQ>` must keep true: …" (up to two facts linked via `constrains`, `requires_property`, `requires_predicate` or `requires_rule`) and "Decision: `<ADR>`" for the lead requirement. Read snippets keep the requirement and test lines only.
  - A superseded, deprecated or retired lead requirement gets no "must keep true" or "Decision" lines, so retired policy is not shown as current.
  - Claude Code: the `PreToolUse` edit snippet now comes from the shared builder (no change in content).
  - Cursor: `preToolUse` edit guidance and `beforeReadFile` / read guidance include the shared snippet for files whose symbols implement a requirement, followed by the existing "query before you change it" follow-up.
  - Codex: `PreToolUse` on `apply_patch` (and other edit tools) returns the snippet as `additionalContext`, for up to three changed files per call and once per file per session. Paths come from the patch's `*** Update/Add/Delete File:` headers.
  - ZCode: `PreToolUse` on edit tools returns the snippet as `additionalContext`, including "The edit is inside `<symbol>`" when the edited text is found, once per file per session.
  - OpenCode: the edit-guidance system prompt adds one "must keep true … Decision …" bullet (one fact) for the focus file, within the existing word budget.
  - `readEntitySummary` returns frontmatter `links` (plain entries read as `relates_to`; `type` and `target` in either order) merged with the entity's records in `.kb/relationships` shards, so grounding stored only in shards still reaches the snippet.
  - Session and discovery hints point at `kb_search` questions and its answer layer instead of asking for `rankingMode: "intent-v1"`, which is now the default.

### Patch Changes

- 89870c1: Bootstrap now checks its write actions before review and application, so ordinary require/forbid claims can be applied without malformed facts or semantic-inventory failures. Invalid and ungroundable claims remain cited authoring follow-ups; product intent receives priority over repository observations, and excluded or unreadable candidates are reported. Deterministic failures stop in a terminal journal with committed actions listed and guidance to re-plan; interrupted writes still recover.

  Encode polarity as an `eq` boolean `true` comparison with a require/forbid modifier in the shared strict builder, retaining existing stable IDs. Add writer-schema and semantic-inventory preflight, per-claim extraction diagnostics, task-list normalization, selection accounting, and terminal failure reporting through CLI/MCP status and result envelopes.

  Migration: KB schema 7 makes `strict-fact-shape` a blocking canonical check. Run `kibi migrate --yes`, then `kibi sync`. The migration rewrites legacy polarity-only property facts to the typed boolean encoding while preserving IDs, polarity, relationships, and document bodies. Other malformed strict facts require explicit correction; they are not treated as proof.

- 15356de: Host hooks no longer ask for a `kb_check` after a `kb_upsert` dry run. A dry run only validates, so the Cursor, Codex, ZCode and OpenCode hooks now count it as validation rather than a KB write.
  - `extractKbMcpToolCall` reports `kb_upsert` with `dryRun: true` as `kb_validate_upsert`.
  - OpenCode's freshness evidence records a dry-run upsert as `kb_validate_upsert`, which carries no mutation evidence.

- 1012d1c: Kibi keeps answering from the right place when you work in a git worktree, a detached checkout, or on a machine without Prolog. Host launchers no longer pin the MCP server to the first workspace, so per-call workspace routing keeps working, and a missing Prolog runtime points at `kibi doctor` instead of failing opaquely.
  - Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and Z Code launchers set `KIBI_MCP_ATTACH_ROOT` instead of `KIBI_WORKSPACE`; the server starts in that directory without disabling routing. `KIBI_WORKSPACE`, `KIBI_PROJECT_ROOT` and `KIBI_ROOT` still pin.
  - A detached HEAD whose commit is the tip of exactly one local branch attaches that branch's KB.
  - `kb_status` reports `swipl_*` error codes with a `kibi doctor` remediation when the Prolog runtime cannot be resolved.
  - CI and publish check that the committed Claude hook bundle matches its source.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- f93dcdd: Bootstrap no longer learns only from the code. The agent now starts with a short interview: it asks where product intent already lives (issue trackers such as Jira or YouTrack, wikis, specs, decision logs), which sources are authoritative or stale, and reads them through its own connectors. The bootstrap plan records those sources and the intent claims harvested from them, so each requirement taken from a ticket or page cites it and the citation is part of the approved plan hash. Kibi still never contacts those sources itself.
  - feat(cli): `kb_plan_bootstrap` / `plan-bootstrap` accept `bootstrapContext.knowledgeSources` (id, kind, title, locator, authority, optional connector) and `bootstrapContext.intentClaims` (statement, sourceId, reference, optional excerpt). Both are normalized into `declaredContext` and bound into `planHash`. Grounded claims from authoritative or supporting sources become `req` candidates with `sourceKind: intent_claim`, citation evidence, and `text_ref: <sourceId>:<reference>`. Ungroundable claims become authoring follow-ups, stale sources are suppressed with `stale_knowledge_source`, and claims citing undeclared sources are reported as non-blocking diagnostics. A `needs_context` plan without declared sources asks for them.
  - feat(skills): `kibi-bootstrap` 3.1.0 leads with the source interview before planning; the MCP `/kibi-bootstrap` prompt and the Cursor and ZCode commands follow it.
  - docs: README, landing page, quick start, and install guide lead with a copy-paste agent setup prompt; manual installation moves behind a toggle.

### Patch Changes

- 676bac9: The Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and ZCode plugins now tell the Kibi MCP server which workspace each call is about, so sessions working in a git worktree are answered from that worktree's branch instead of the checkout the server started in. Nothing changes for sessions that stay in one project.
  - Each plugin's pre-tool hook adds `workspaceRoot`, the agent's current Kibi workspace, to every Kibi MCP call. Claude Code, Cursor, and ZCode send it without a permission decision so the host's own approval flow is unchanged; Codex requires `permissionDecision: "allow"` for input rewrites, which does not override a server's tool approval mode.
  - `kibi-agent-core` exports `KIBI_WORKSPACE_ARGUMENT`, `isKibiMcpToolName`, and `stampKibiWorkspace` for the plugins.
  - The Codex hook parser now reads `hook_event_name`, the field Codex actually sends; the Claude and ZCode `PreToolUse` matchers include `mcp__.*__kb_.*`.
  - The ZCode launcher sets `KIBI_MCP_HOST=zcode` so its usage rows are attributed like the other hosts'.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- db5376c: Projects can now opt into impact reviews that bind a change to its exact source, knowledge decisions and trusted analysis policy. Kibi validates both staged changes and a complete pull-request diff, rejects stale review evidence, and lets agents prepare an unauthored review template through the CLI or MCP instead of hand-assembling one. Every decision and reviewer field stays for an agent to write; preparation never approves or proves anything.
  - Add versioned impact policy and review schemas, immutable review fingerprints, reviewed Python decorator coordinate migration and the trusted aggregate `check-diff` command.
  - Add the read-only `prepare-impact-review --input` CLI route and `kb_prepare_impact_review` MCP operation; regenerate the bundled operation-access catalog for the agent integrations.
  - Keep the sample CI workflow inactive until it is adopted on a protected target.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 35cd120: The ZCode, Codex, and Cursor plugins now recognize Kibi tools when the host
  reports them with a prefix, such as `mcp__kibi__kb_check`. Before this fix,
  an agent that correctly ran an impact check through a prefixed tool name
  still got a stop reminder to run it, because the plugin never saw the check.
  - `kb-mcp-tools.ts` in each adapter gains `canonicalKbToolName`, which strips
    `mcp__<server>__`, `MCP:`, and `kibi_` prefixes before matching `kb_*`
    operations.
  - The Codex hook bundle is regenerated.

- 5a06c03: Kibi's agent plugins now share one fast, consistent implementation for source-path classification, Kibi MCP tool recognition, and symbol-manifest indexing. Codex and ZCode now recognize production code outside `src/`, while Cursor reuses the same size-and-mtime-keyed scanner as Claude instead of parsing the full symbol manifest before an edit.
  - Add `kibi-agent-core` as the common Node 18-compatible hook-helper package.
  - Keep host adapters thin while preserving their host-specific event and state contracts.
  - Replace Cursor's YAML parser dependency with the shared cached line scanner.

- 0128b56: Kibi now helps agents keep one shared vocabulary instead of letting every requirement invent its own. `kibi check` warns when two unrelated requirements state the same obligation. Units are compared in canonical form, so "30 min" matches "1800 s", and each warning names the exact facts involved. It also flags subject keys copied from a requirement ID, subject keys that don't follow `component.aspect`, predicates whose arguments read like prose, and entity files whose name doesn't match their ID. All of these are non-blocking warnings or info notes, so existing knowledge bases keep passing.

  When you model a new requirement, Kibi now ranks the subjects that already exist and either reuses one or explicitly declares a new one. It also flags claims that look like possible duplicates. An intentional restatement can be recorded with the new `restates` relationship. Skills and docs now recommend naming entities by the behavior they govern (`REQ-cli-gc`) instead of a sequence number (`REQ-042`). Existing numbered IDs stay valid.

  Predicate schemas can now declare the allowed values for an argument, plus the old spellings that map onto them. New facts must use those values. `kibi check` reports predicate facts that don't match any schema, and `kibi migrate` can fix the mechanical cases after you approve the plan hash. It moves a fact to the only namespace whose schema matches, and rewrites old spellings to the declared value. Everything that needs judgment stays a review item.
  - core: new `semantic_quality.pl` (`entity-id-style`, `domain-redundancy`, `domain-implication`, `subject-key-identity`, `subject-key-shape`, `ontology-quality`) and `units.pl`. Unit canonicalization is used for comparison only, and unknown or ambiguous units such as `KB` are never equated. Adds the `restates` req→req relationship and an optional `diagnosticSeverity` in the rule registry. Adds `:- encoding(utf8)` to modules that contain non-ASCII text.
  - cli/mcp: `restates` is wired through the extractors, schemas, and mutation paths. `entity-id-style` warnings are reported on `kb_upsert` creates and on staged added or renamed entity files. `kb_model_requirement` returns `vocabularyAlignment` (subject decision, candidates, redundancy candidates, stamps, `fallbackUsed`). Ontology-quality thresholds can be set with `KIBI_ONTOLOGY_QUALITY_MAX_SINGLETON_RATIO` / `KIBI_ONTOLOGY_QUALITY_MIN_FACTS`. `kb_compile_intent` create mode now keeps a caller-supplied `requirementId`. `kibi check --staged` now also prints its pass line when metadata-only staged changes have only advisory findings, matching the staged-symbol path.
  - cli/mcp: `predicate_schema` facts accept `argument_constants` and `argument_aliases`, stored like `rule_ir` as JSON. `kb_upsert` / `kb_validate_upsert` reject malformed vocabularies and predicate facts that use undeclared values or aliases. `kb_suggest_predicates` binds aliases to their constant and leaves undeclared values unbound. The new advisory TypeScript rule `predicate-schema-conformance` checks predicate facts against project schemas and the built-in catalog. Its mechanical repairs become automatic `predicate_schema_alignment` migration actions that carry the exact `kb_upsert` input and re-read the fact before writing.
  - core: `ontology-quality` findings name the prose-like arguments.
  - plugin-sdk: new `kibi.vocabulary-alignment.v1` capability (`rankSubjects`, `compareClaims`) with result validators.
  - plugin-builtin: deterministic offline provider (IDF-weighted subject ranking and negation- and quantity-aware claim similarity).
  - plugin-jev: Jev-backed provider. It runs in replace, augment, or shadow mode with builtin fallback, and makes network calls only when it is activated for `kb_model_requirement`. `kb_check` never calls a provider.
  - runtime and agent adapters: regenerated skill mirrors with the naming guidance and `restates` direction docs.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e9a8158: Kibi now ships a native ZCode plugin. Teams working in ZCode get the four
  bundled Kibi workflow skills, a `/kibi-bootstrap` slash command, advisory
  lifecycle hooks, and the Kibi MCP server without hand-editing any ZCode
  configuration — and without the plugin making a sound in workspaces that never
  adopted Kibi. Local ZCode development, package builds, and tests use Linux/WSL
  in this release.
  - Install via the repo marketplace from a locally built checkout: run
    `bun run build:zcode`, then in ZCode open Settings → Plugin Management →
    Discover, add the repository directory with the `+` button (marketplace
    manifest at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, plugin at `packages/zcode`),
    and install `kibi-zcode`. GitHub-source installs are unsupported — the
    generated `dist/hook-runner.js` is not committed, and marketplace copies
    never build; `prepack` applies only to npm packaging flows.
  - `.zcode-plugin/plugin.json` declares the skills, command, hooks, and an
    inline `mcpServers` entry verified against ZCode's strict schemas (stdio
    servers accept only `command`/`args`/`cwd`/`env`/`enabled`/`timeoutMs`;
    hook matchers are case-sensitive regexes, so "match all" is expressed by
    omitting the matcher rather than a bare `*`).
  - `hooks/hooks.json` wires `SessionStart`, `PreToolUse` (edit-like tools),
    `PostToolUse`, and `Stop` to `dist/hook-runner.js`. Outputs use the exact
    ZCode contract (`hookSpecificOutput.hookEventName` + `additionalContext`):
    direct `.kb/` edits get an advisory warning, opted-in sessions get discovery
    guidance, and stops remind about impact checks and freshness. Tracking is
    mutation-based (read-only tool calls never count as changes), compares
    canonical workspace-relative paths across edits and `kb_check` sourceFiles,
    invalidates a covering impact check when the same path is edited again, and
    is namespaced per host session so concurrent ZCode sessions in one workspace
    cannot consume or clear each other's pending reminders. Hard enforcement
    stays with the Kibi git hooks.
  - The skills mirror (`packages/zcode/skills/`) rewrites each canonical
    SKILL.md frontmatter to ZCode's recognized key set (`name`, `description`,
    `license`, `metadata`) so skills are marked `safeToAutoLoad`; bodies and
    resources stay byte-identical to `packages/runtime/src/skills/`, enforced by
    a drift test. `scripts/sync-agent-skills.ts` gained a `zcode` target.
  - `bin/mcp-launcher.cjs` keeps non-Kibi workspaces silent: a zero-tool MCP
    session when no `.kb/manifest.json` exists at the resolved Kibi project
    root, a proxy of the resolved `kibi-mcp` (project-local package entry first
    via Node's own resolution, then a PATH lookup — launched shell-free through
    `process.execPath`, so it also works on Windows without command
    interpreters) when it does, and a guidance session that distinguishes a
    missing installation from a launch failure.
  - The launcher resolves export-restricted local `kibi-mcp` installs through
    their public Node entry and declared `bin`, so a working local package wins
    over PATH while a broken local package is surfaced rather than silently
    replaced. Its shell-free `process.execPath` launch path retains the runtime
    handling needed for Windows npm shims.
  - Packaging: `files` ships the manifest, launcher, hooks, skills, command, and
    built `dist/`; `scripts/sync-plugin-manifest-versions.ts` keeps the plugin
    manifest version in sync with the package version; root scripts gained
    `build:zcode`, `dev:zcode`, and matching typecheck entries wired into the
    `build`, `typecheck`, and `pack:all` chains.

### Patch Changes

- 96db9d8: The bundled kibi-usage skill now documents how to debug proof-ratchet regressions: when `kibi prove` or the proof baseline check fails, follow the new "Debugging proof regressions" section in `resources/proof.md`. It explains how to read the failure with `kibi proof explain`, compare current proof state against the committed `proof/baseline.json` ratchet with `kibi proof impact`, and resolve regressions by restoring real coverage (tests, symbol ownership, fresh receipts) instead of lowering the baseline. Agent sessions get a canonical recovery path instead of improvising around proof failures.
  - Add "Debugging proof regressions" guidance to `kibi-usage/resources/proof.md`
  - Point `kibi-usage/SKILL.md` at the new section and bump the skill version to 2.1.3

- c77b371: Proof coverage reaches every requirement that has honest end-to-end evidence: fourteen new packed end-to-end tests wire previously unproven scenarios (status freshness, conservative proof reporting, snapshot relevance, MCP model-requirement and freshness, schema version, strict modeling, plan-hash enforcement, OpenCode enforcement, briefing removal, Prolog/SPARQL adoption, check-gate enforcement, evaluator gold runs, batch diagnostics) into the proof ladder, and requirements that are historically retired can now actually opt out of E2E proof.
  - `kb_check` with `async: true` returns a `kibi.job.v1` receipt whose shape is declared in the tool's output contract, so hosts no longer reject the response schema mismatch on large KBs.
  - Authored `proof_exempt` / `proof_exempt_reason` frontmatter on requirement documents is now extracted and persisted; previously the exemption was silently dropped on sync.
  - The MCP JSON-Schema-to-Zod bridge converts `anyOf` unions faithfully for declared output contracts (input `oneOf` guards keep their intentional lenient behavior).
  - Proof-entity maintenance: stale `SYM-proof-runner` obligation removed from the journaled-engine harness contract, and `REQ-*` inline annotations repointed to the modeled verification-evidence requirement.
  - New proof obligations: `TEST-e2e-*` packed scenarios, `TEST-kibi-change-to-proof-evaluation-live` gold-corpus run, and `TEST-e2e-root-batch-diagnostics`; `runBatch` is exported from the curated suite runner for diagnostic reuse.
