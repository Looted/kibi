# kibi-codex

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- b2b1792: Kibi guidance now helps agents distinguish suitable relational predicates from scalar constraints and review-only claims without replacing readable requirements. CLI, Codex, and Cursor users receive the same predicate-first decision tree and authoritative examples, reducing invented predicates and unsafe modeling.

  - Add built-in, project-local, deny, strict-scalar, ambiguity, false-positive, and ontology-gap guidance to the canonical `kibi-usage` skill.
  - Regenerate the Codex and Cursor mirrors with matching canonical hashes.

### Patch Changes

- 610b5be: The improved Kibi guidance skills will ship to CLI, Codex, and Cursor users in the next package release. This keeps the canonical CLI skill bundle and the generated client-plugin mirrors aligned for downstream installs.

  - Release the canonical skills bundled by `kibi-cli`.
  - Release the generated `kibi-codex` and `kibi-cursor` skill mirrors.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- a0fee4a: The Codex plugin now supports capability-based Kibi interface selection, using visible MCP tools first and a trusted project-local CLI fallback when needed. Agents can retain the same 18-operation workflow when MCP is unavailable without falling back to direct knowledge-base file access.

  - Add MCP-first, CLI-fallback agent guidance.
  - Ship the generated operation-access resource with all four Kibi skills.

### Patch Changes

- cafa25f: Agents can now select Kibi by available capability instead of stopping at MCP-specific guidance. The bundled skills prefer approved MCP tools, fall back safely to a project-local non-installing CLI runner, and provide executable JSON recipes plus an exact 18-operation access catalog.

  - Document every shared MCP operation's dedicated CLI route, input mode, effects, Prolog requirement, mutability, and telemetry handling.
  - Regenerate Cursor and Codex skill mirrors from the canonical capability-based source.

## 0.17.1

### Patch Changes

- f1db710: Kibi check outputs now have a stable advisory diagnostics lane for auditability review signals. Operators and MCP clients can receive `qualityDiagnostics` alongside hard `violations` without advisory-only findings changing pass/fail counts or exit behavior. Existing staged impact failures, including symbol granularity violations, remain blocking. Source impact analysis now also highlights overly broad symbols, indistinguishable symbol coordinates, and mixed-purpose component/class ownership as review-only guidance.

  Technical summary:

  - Add the public `QualityDiagnostic` type with `error`, `warning`, `review`, and `info` severities plus explicit `blocking` semantics.
  - Preserve existing `violations`, `diagnostics`, and `impactDiagnostics` fields while adding MCP structured `qualityDiagnostics` output support.
  - Preserve explicitly filtered MCP `kb_check` rule semantics so advisory full-KB quality scans only run for unfiltered checks or requested impact diagnostics.
  - Clarify Codex and Cursor bundled agent guidance so targeted checks use explicit rules and final checks omit rules for full-KB `qualityDiagnostics` review.
  - Add quality diagnostic text formatting and shared blocking helpers that treat `blocking: true` or `severity: "error"` as hard failures.
  - Add non-blocking `multi_requirement_symbol_review`, `duplicate_symbol_coordinate_review`, and `component_mixed_purpose_review` impact diagnostics.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- Kibi now gives agents source-impact feedback while they are still editing, instead of waiting for the commit hook to be the first signal. Meaningful source edits can be checked through MCP with changed-file impact diagnostics, so agents see coarse symbol ownership, stale symbol evidence, and semantic-review prompts while the source context is fresh. OpenCode, Cursor, and Codex adapters now steer agents toward that MCP-first workflow and keep CLI/hooks as the later safety net.

  Technical summary:

  - Add reusable CLI changed-file impact diagnostics and export them for MCP consumption.
  - Extend MCP `kb_check` with source-file impact options and structured impact output.
  - Update OpenCode, Cursor, and Codex guidance/hooks to request impact-enabled `kb_check` after source edits.
  - Document semantic-review diagnostics and class-member granularity expectations.

## 0.16.1

### Patch Changes

- Kibi now gives agents clearer guidance for the diagnostics flow, so the release notes should reflect that the bundled usage text and MCP logging story were tightened together.

  This update also keeps the package mirrors aligned where applicable, which helps downstream plugin consumers stay in sync with the canonical guidance.

  - Hardened bundled skill guidance for kibi usage.
  - Improved MCP diagnostic logging shape and validation hints.
  - Synced packaged skill copies where they are shipped with the release.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- e4d1919: Codex users can now install an optional Kibi adapter package for bundled Kibi skills, MCP configuration, and warning-only lifecycle hooks. This gives teams a managed Codex entry point while keeping `kibi-core`, `kibi-cli`, and `kibi-mcp` as the foundation for project-local Kibi operations. Teams that do not use the plugin can continue to configure Codex manually against the local `kibi-mcp` command.

  - Add the publishable `kibi-codex` package with Codex plugin manifest assets, bundled skills, hook declarations, and MCP config.
  - Add a conservative hook runner with bounded dirty-path state and advisory-only setup/freshness messages.
  - Wire `kibi-codex` into workspace build, pack, release-state, publish, CI unit coverage, docs, and local marketplace verification.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial Codex plugin package skeleton for Kibi.
