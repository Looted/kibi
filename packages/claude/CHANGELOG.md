# kibi-claude

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- f93dcdd: Bootstrap no longer learns only from the code. The agent now starts with a short interview: it asks where product intent already lives (issue trackers such as Jira or YouTrack, wikis, specs, decision logs), which sources are authoritative or stale, and reads them through its own connectors. The bootstrap plan records those sources and the intent claims harvested from them, so each requirement taken from a ticket or page cites it and the citation is part of the approved plan hash. Kibi still never contacts those sources itself.
  - feat(cli): `kb_plan_bootstrap` / `plan-bootstrap` accept `bootstrapContext.knowledgeSources` (id, kind, title, locator, authority, optional connector) and `bootstrapContext.intentClaims` (statement, sourceId, reference, optional excerpt). Both are normalized into `declaredContext` and bound into `planHash`. Grounded claims from authoritative or supporting sources become `req` candidates with `sourceKind: intent_claim`, citation evidence, and `text_ref: <sourceId>:<reference>`. Ungroundable claims become authoring follow-ups, stale sources are suppressed with `stale_knowledge_source`, and claims citing undeclared sources are reported as non-blocking diagnostics. A `needs_context` plan without declared sources asks for them.
  - feat(skills): `kibi-bootstrap` 3.1.0 leads with the source interview before planning; the MCP `/kibi-bootstrap` prompt and the Cursor and ZCode commands follow it.
  - docs: README, landing page, quick start, and install guide lead with a copy-paste agent setup prompt; manual installation moves behind a toggle.

- 5a217be: The Claude Code plugin can now record what an agent did around its Kibi calls, so you can see whether it looked up requirements before editing or only afterwards. MCP and CLI rows show which Kibi operations ran, but not the reads and edits between them, and that was the question the earlier data could not answer. Recording is off unless `KIBI_DIAGNOSTIC_MODE=1` is set, the same opt-in the MCP server and CLI use.
  - Append `interface: "hook"` rows to `.kb/usage.log` for reads, edits, Grep/Glob searches, `.kb/` access, Kibi calls, and Stop reminders. Each row carries `hook_action` (shown vs. silent), `path`, `path_kind`, owning `requirement_ids`, `kb_operation`, `kb_used_before`, and the host `session_id`.
  - Rows are best effort and never change hook output; files outside the knowledge surface are not recorded.
  - Rebuild `bin/hook-runner.mjs`.

### Patch Changes

- 676bac9: The Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and ZCode plugins now tell the Kibi MCP server which workspace each call is about, so sessions working in a git worktree are answered from that worktree's branch instead of the checkout the server started in. Nothing changes for sessions that stay in one project.
  - Each plugin's pre-tool hook adds `workspaceRoot`, the agent's current Kibi workspace, to every Kibi MCP call. Claude Code, Cursor, and ZCode send it without a permission decision so the host's own approval flow is unchanged; Codex requires `permissionDecision: "allow"` for input rewrites, which does not override a server's tool approval mode.
  - `kibi-agent-core` exports `KIBI_WORKSPACE_ARGUMENT`, `isKibiMcpToolName`, and `stampKibiWorkspace` for the plugins.
  - The Codex hook parser now reads `hook_event_name`, the field Codex actually sends; the Claude and ZCode `PreToolUse` matchers include `mcp__.*__kb_.*`.
  - The ZCode launcher sets `KIBI_MCP_HOST=zcode` so its usage rows are attributed like the other hosts'.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- db5376c: Projects can now opt into impact reviews that bind a change to its exact source, knowledge decisions and trusted analysis policy. Kibi validates both staged changes and a complete pull-request diff, rejects stale review evidence, and lets agents prepare an unauthored review template through the CLI or MCP instead of hand-assembling one. Every decision and reviewer field stays for an agent to write; preparation never approves or proves anything.
  - Add versioned impact policy and review schemas, immutable review fingerprints, reviewed Python decorator coordinate migration and the trusted aggregate `check-diff` command.
  - Add the read-only `prepare-impact-review --input` CLI route and `kb_prepare_impact_review` MCP operation; regenerate the bundled operation-access catalog for the agent integrations.
  - Keep the sample CI workflow inactive until it is adopted on a protected target.

- 3d78159: Setting up Kibi no longer starts with installing SWI-Prolog. The documentation now says that Linux (x64 and arm64, glibc 2.28 or newer) and macOS (Apple silicon and Intel) need nothing beyond Node.js 22, explains the lookup order and the `KIBI_SWIPL` and `KIBI_SWIPL=system` overrides, and shows how `kibi doctor` reports which SWI-Prolog is in use and what to do when an install skipped the bundled runtime (`--omit=optional`, pnpm `supportedArchitectures`). Manual instructions stay for Alpine and native Windows. The GitHub Pages report workflows that `kibi init` can write no longer install SWI-Prolog by hand, because `npm ci` brings the bundled runtime with it.
  - kibi-cli: drop the `apt-get install swi-prolog` step from the shipped `kibi-report.yml` and `kibi-badge.yml` workflow templates.
  - kibi-cursor, kibi-claude: README and plugin manifest prerequisites say SWI-Prolog is bundled on supported platforms and only needed on `PATH` elsewhere.
  - Kibi's own CI and proof now run the pipeline-built bundled SWI-Prolog (one job keeps a system install with `KIBI_SWIPL=system`), and the release dry run follows the README quick start with the packed tarballs on four platforms; neither ships in a package.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 35cd120: Kibi now ships a Claude Code plugin. When an agent reads or edits code that
  the knowledge base links to requirements, it sees a short note first. The
  note lists which requirements that code implements, which tests cover it, and
  which symbol the edit lands in, plus the exact Kibi call for the full detail.
  Before the agent finishes, it gets one reminder to run an impact check on
  source files it changed. The plugin says nothing in projects without Kibi,
  repeats nothing within a session, and goes quiet once the agent is already
  using Kibi. It installs straight from GitHub through the repository
  marketplace.
  - New `packages/claude` plugin (`kibi-claude`): `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`,
    `.mcp.json` with a `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`-aware workspace-gated launcher,
    `hooks/hooks.json` (`SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`),
    a committed self-contained hook bundle (`bin/hook-runner.mjs`, drift-tested),
    and a skills mirror whose `name` is the skill id so plugin slash commands
    stay usable.
  - Hooks never call the CLI: a line scanner indexes `.kb/symbols.yaml` and
    `.kb/symbol-coordinates.yaml` (equivalent to a full YAML parse, about 20x
    faster) and caches it in `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`, keyed by manifest size and
    mtime.
  - Session memory is an append-only journal, so concurrent hooks for parallel
    tool calls do not lose events. The Stop reminder uses non-error
    `additionalContext`, fires once per file, and respects `stop_hook_active`.
  - Root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` gains the required `owner` field
    (Claude Code rejected the file without it) and lists `kibi-claude`
    alongside `kibi-zcode`.
  - `scripts/sync-agent-skills.ts` gains a `claude` target.
