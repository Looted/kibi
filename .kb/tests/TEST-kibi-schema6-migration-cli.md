# Consumer CLI migrates a schema 5 KB to schema 6 with migration origins and intact grounding, and a rerun finds nothing to do

Drives a schema 5 workspace through the built `kibi` binary (`packages/cli/tests/consumer/schema6-migration.test.ts`).

- `kibi migrate --dry-run --format json` plans the origin backfill, the semantic inventory re-derivation and the schema upgrade, and writes nothing.
- `kibi migrate --apply-safe` with the approved plan hash applies them; its stdout is the JSON result alone.
- Every migrated entity carries `origin.kind: migration`, the drifted ledger is re-derived while the requirement keeps its logic claims and fact links, `kibi status` is fresh on schema 6 and `kibi check` reports no violations.
- A second `kibi migrate` reports that no migration is needed and changes no file.
