## Test Coverage

### Policy Checks

- The strict fact lane models the operation surface as exactly 18 peer operations.
- The requirement, scenario, test, and ADR links all resolve without dangling references.
- The docs describe MCP and CLI as peers, not as primary and secondary surfaces.
- The CLI reference enumerates all 18 `--input` routes, object-input rules, exit codes `0`/`1`/`2`, and the canonical `find-gaps` command with its `gaps` alias.
- Symbol coverage includes shared operation executors, CLI protocol modules, CLI/MCP runtime adapters, the Cursor worktree resolver, and the canonical skill generator.
- CLI lifecycle tests prove that pending JSON output drains before the entrypoint requests explicit process termination.
- Remote SPARQL operation, CLI JSON, MCP adapter, and parity tests use a loopback-only HTTP fixture and verify shared decoding, HTTP(S)-only validation, and timeout cancellation without public endpoint access.
