# GitHub badge, report init, and PR-vs-Pages workflow tests

Validates `kibi init --github` and `--github --badge-only` option registration,
the `/kibi-report/` public path, canonical workflow scaffolding that does not
overwrite customized files, and that documented example workflows are
byte-identical to the packaged `kibi-cli` templates.

The github-init unit tests also lock the PR-vs-Pages contract: the report
template runs on `pull_request`, uploads `kibi-pr-report` from the generated
`kibi-report/` directory, skips Pages configure/upload/deploy on pull requests,
keeps `pages: write` and `id-token: write` on the deploy job only, and never
uses `pull_request_target`. `packages/cli/tests/commands/init.test.ts` asserts
`kibi init --github` writes that same PR-aware workflow.
