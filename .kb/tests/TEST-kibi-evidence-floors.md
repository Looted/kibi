Runs the installed packed CLI on a sandbox repository and checks the evidence-floor rule end to end: a firm requirement without an end-to-end proof and an unapproved agent requirement with an asserted floor fail kibi check, lowering the first floor and approving the second passes, --fresh-evidence needs a committed tree, and kibi migrate --yes on a schema 10 repository records required_evidence: asserted on a firm requirement without a proof path so the upgraded repository passes.
