Exercises `kibi.distribution-parity.v1` through source and freshly packed CLI/MCP binaries, then optionally through the binaries actually resolved by audited projects. The fixture set checks proposition ingestion, source-bound contradiction witnesses, conservative proof stages, dependency-ordered repair plans, snapshot-bound receipt gaps, and telemetry acceptance. Align is expected to resolve this checkout and match; BizzWords' older pinned CLI/MCP capabilities must be reported as unsupported rather than silently passing, with a named upgrade action for each divergence.
