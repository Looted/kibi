Verifies the packed kibi-opencode plugin's bootstrap path behavior against the canonical .kb/ layout through an isolated npm install of the real tarball.

Executable coverage: `documentation/tests/e2e/packed/opencode-bootstrap-paths.test.ts` — a healthy canonical .kb/ layout (all lanes plus manifest.json) must not emit a bootstrap warning, while a lifecycle manifest whose canonical targets are missing must nudge the agent toward `kibi init` and the canonical bootstrap flow.
