# Generated coordinate persistence and repair E2E

`packages/cli/tests/commands/symbol-coordinate-repair.test.ts` exercises the real CLI against a branch-local KB: same-value upserts preserve RDF coordinates without authored leakage, plain sync remains a no-op over warm-cache divergence, and the explicit approved refresh restores coordinates with a subsequent true no-op sync.
