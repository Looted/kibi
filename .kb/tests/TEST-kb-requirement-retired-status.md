Runs the real `kibi` CLI on temporary Git workspaces (packages/cli/tests/commands/retired-status.test.ts): `kibi sync` and `kibi check --rules retired-reason-missing,retired-owner-only,req-status-vocabulary` over retired, unexplained and closed requirements with owned and shared facts; `kibi search` for the retired behavior; a `kibi upsert` of a retired requirement without a reason; and `kibi migrate --format json` followed by `--apply-safe` with and without `--approved-action req-retired-status-<id>`, comparing the requirement file byte for byte.

A false pass would be a check that reports nothing because the rules never ran; the test therefore also expects the findings it should get (the unshared fact and the unexplained requirement), and the migration test expects the unapproved apply to leave the file untouched before the approved one changes exactly two lines.
