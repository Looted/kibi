Run `bun test ./packages/core/tests/prolog-coverage-runner.test.ts`. The repeated-option case supplies a passing file followed by a failing file in another directory, then checks the later case is reported, the run fails, and the later file appears among annotated coverage artifacts. The suite also checks threshold failure and a fully covered success case.
