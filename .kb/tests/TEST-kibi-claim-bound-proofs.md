Runs the installed packed CLI on a sandbox repository where the semantic advisor models "Palette colors must be one of red, green or blue" as a set fact, and exhaustive tests name that claim in proof_contract.proves. After kibi prove --all, the test over a domain that is exactly the set gets a derived claim binding and kibi prove prints it; a domain missing a member and an unknown claim key get rejected bindings with the reason; kibi check --rules proof-contract-claims reports those contracts and the one without proves; and kibi proof explain lists the claim with its bindings.
