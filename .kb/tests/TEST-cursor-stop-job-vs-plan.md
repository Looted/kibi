Verification for Cursor stop-hook plan-versus-job behavior lives in `packages/cursor` unit tests:

- `packages/cursor/tests/hook-runner.test.ts` covers Read/Grep silence, `CreatePlan` silence, `CreatePlan` plus Write impact follow-up, `CreatePlan` plus `kb_upsert` summary, `SwitchMode` not counting as plan delivery, and aborted stop status.
- `packages/cursor/tests/messages.test.ts` covers `stopFollowupMessage` plan-delivery silence versus remaining follow-ups when dirty paths or KB mutations exist.
- `packages/cursor/tests/hook-input.test.ts` covers `stop.status` parsing.
- `packages/cursor/tests/hook-state.test.ts` covers `planDelivered` persistence.

`packages/cursor/README.md` must state that stop follow-up is for finished implementation turns, not plan delivery, and that reads do not count as edits.
