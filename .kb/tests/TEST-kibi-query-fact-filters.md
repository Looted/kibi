# kb_query typed fact questions and the answer-layer fact claims are verified in Prolog and TypeScript

Runs the `discovery_ask` unit in `packages/core/tests/kb.plt` (positional and named predicate patterns, effective allow/deny decisions, current-requirement scope, distinct counts through the schema, unknown predicate and argument handling, suggestions when nothing matched, property queries, the schema catalog and fact-kind listings), the `kb_query asks predicate facts by name`, `kb_query routes property, catalog and fact-kind questions` and `kb_query rejects malformed typed fact questions` tests in `packages/cli/tests/operations/discovery.test.ts` (goal building from validated JSON, factQuery payload and next calls, input validation before any Prolog call), and `linked typed facts state their claim and the kb_query that asks about them` in `packages/cli/tests/search-answer.test.ts`.
