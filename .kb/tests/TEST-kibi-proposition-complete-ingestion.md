Exercises the packed CLI from an isolated consumer installation. The suite proves direct preflight rejection, post-baseline Markdown rejection for a new incomplete requirement, and successful ingestion of the same prose when it carries the exact advisor-compatible version, source hash, claim key, role, status, and UTF-8 span. Unit and parity suites additionally cover duplicate identities, explicit unresolved states, exact grounding claim keys, modeling-plan completeness, and schema preservation.
