Asserts that:
- all canonical entity types (`req`, `scenario`, `test`, `adr`, `flag`, `event`, `symbol`, and `fact`) are present and queryable
- unsupported types are rejected at query time
- required fields are persisted with canonical timestamps and source provenance
- typed relationships are stored and reloaded with provenance from a fresh CLI process
