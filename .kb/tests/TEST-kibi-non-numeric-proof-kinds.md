Runs the installed packed CLI on a sandbox repository where the semantic advisor models an invoice number format as a string fact with operator matches and invoice status transitions as a set fact, and model-requirement records "Archived documents must never be shared" as a kibi.logic.v1 rule. After kibi prove --all, the regex test over the anchored pattern, the state_machine test over the transition table and the rule test over the sharing function get derived claim bindings at evidence level proved; a pattern that also accepts longer strings is rejected with a string only it accepts, and a sharing function that lets owners share archived documents is rejected with the assignment that breaks the rule. The unit suite checks the regular-language decisions against V8, the Python and JavaScript model evaluation, and the Prolog model checker.
