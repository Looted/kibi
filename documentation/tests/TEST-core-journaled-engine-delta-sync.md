Contract fixtures cover no-op, one-symbol, relationship-only, deletion,
coordinate-only, and rebuild sync paths through the Node CLI and MCP.
The generated 10,000-symbol/30,000-edge fixture excludes setup from timed
regions and enforces every release gate: warm exact and paginated query p95 at
or below 100 ms; warm search and status p95 at or below 150 ms; ordinary
durable upsert p95 at or below 500 ms; no-op sync at or below 500 ms;
one-symbol sync p95 below one second; cold attach plus index build at or below
three seconds; full sync at or below 30 seconds; and steady-state engine RSS at
or below 512 MiB.
