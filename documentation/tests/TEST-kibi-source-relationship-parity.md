The packed consumer test creates a tracked authored relationship after the initial compile, proves the scoped parity rule blocks on the exact missing edge, syncs, and proves the scoped check passes. Unit coverage separately proves runtime-only reverse ownership does not weaken authored-to-compiled detection.
