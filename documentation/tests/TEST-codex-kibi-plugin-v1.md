Verification for `kibi-codex` documentation and plugin onboarding guidance includes:

- Ensure `packages/codex/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` exports plugin manifest paths and MCP config for the project-local `kibi-mcp` server.
- Ensure `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` exposes `kibi-codex` from `./packages/codex` for repo-scoped Codex marketplace installs.
- Ensure installation guidance in `README.md` and `docs/install.md` states `kibi-codex` is optional and keeps `kibi-core`, `kibi-cli`, and `kibi-mcp` as foundational runtime dependencies.
- Ensure installation guidance documents `codex plugin marketplace add Looted/kibi` and explains that official OpenAI Plugin Directory self-serve publishing is not yet available.
- Ensure the optional Codex plugin section documents hook bundle behavior, required plugin trust review, and fallback/manual MCP configuration.
- Ensure `docs/architecture.md` models the Codex plugin as an adapter layer that connects to MCP/Kibi rather than replacing storage or core CLI behavior.
- Ensure no documentation claims official marketplace acceptance as already complete.
