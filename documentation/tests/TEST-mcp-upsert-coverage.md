- run `bun test --coverage packages/mcp/tests/tools/upsert.test.ts packages/mcp/tests/tools/upsert-contradictions.test.ts packages/mcp/tests/tools/crud.test.ts`
- verify `packages/mcp/src/tools/upsert.ts` reports 100% line coverage
- verify mocked paths cover validation, contradiction formatting, audit/save failures, and symbol refresh warnings
