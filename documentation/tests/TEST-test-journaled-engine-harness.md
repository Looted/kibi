The harness tests verify graceful signal-driven journal flush and replay,
shared interactive Prolog fixtures for ordinary behavior, exact CLI metadata
and lazy-loader parity, bounded root-suite concurrency and deterministic
summaries, shared packed installation setup, private engine runtime ownership,
and teardown before fixture deletion.

The full curated unit and packed E2E suites provide the integration evidence:
they must complete without leaked test-owned engines, isolation failures, or
contract drift across CLI and MCP surfaces.
