"kibi-mcp": patch

Fix MCP write and validation consistency by making `kb_upsert` atomic across entity and relationship assertions, and aligning `kb_check` with the full aggregated rule set plus `.kb/config.json` check settings. This prevents partial writes on failed relationship links and keeps MCP traceability checks consistent with CLI expectations.
