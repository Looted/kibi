"kibi-runtime": patch
---

Runtime builds now clean stale bundled skills before copying, so skills removed from source (like the retired `init-kibi` autopilot) no longer linger in `dist/skills/` and leak into packed distributions and the MCP skills list.

The kibi-runtime build script previously only ran `mkdir -p dist/skills && cp -r src/skills/. dist/skills/`, which never removed directories that had been deleted from `src/skills/`. After the bootstrap-plan onboarding change replaced the `init-kibi` autopilot with the canonical `kibi-bootstrap` skill, every rebuild silently resurrected the removed skill from the previous build output. Consumers listing bundled skills saw a ghost `init-kibi` entry alongside `kibi-bootstrap`, and the MCP skills-adapter contract caught the mismatch. The build now mirrors the CLI package's behavior and runs `rm -rf dist/skills` before repopulating it.

- build: remove `dist/skills` before copying `src/skills` in `packages/runtime/package.json`
