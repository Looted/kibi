"kibi-runtime": patch
---

Ship a self-contained engine daemon in the published `kibi-runtime` package so packed consumers can start the Kibi engine.

The runtime bundle inlines `kibi-cli` operation code whose daemon lookup expects `engine-daemon.js` beside the bundle or under a nested `kibi-cli` install. Published-shaped installs (npm or pnpm isolated mode) have neither, so first-party MCP hosts failed with "The Kibi engine is not built. Run `npm run build:cli`" on first engine use. The runtime build now bundles `packages/cli/src/engine-daemon.ts` into `dist/engine-daemon.js`, giving the existing lookup a working entry point without adding dependencies.
