Bootstrap plans no longer drop the intent claims you declared from tracker, wiki or spec sources when the repository has many candidates. Previously the default 50-candidate cap could silently discard every claim from one source, and two markdown lines that restated one rule could leave an approved plan half-applied. Now every declared claim is planned, each source reports how many of its claims were planned, and a plan that plans none of an authoritative source's claims asks for context instead of reporting ready.

`kb_plan_bootstrap` applies `maxCandidates` only to discovered candidates. Candidates that would rewrite an already-planned entity with different content are suppressed as `duplicate_entity`, and the write-time `claim_key` grounding check now also runs at plan time against planned writes, suppressing mismatches as `invalid_write`. The plan adds one `Knowledge source …` diagnostic per declared source. The `kibi-bootstrap` skill (3.2.1) tells agents to read those diagnostics and no longer advises against `maxCandidates`.
