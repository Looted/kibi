The telemetry acceptance and remediation reports now show whether agents look requirements up before they change requirement-linked code. A new `lookup_before_first_edit` metric gives, per host session, the share of sessions that ran `kb_search` or `kb_query` (through MCP or the CLI) before their first edit of a file whose symbols implement a requirement. Sessions that edited first appear in the report with the file and its exact `.kb/usage.log` line. The data comes from opt-in hook rows that every Kibi host plugin now writes when `KIBI_DIAGNOSTIC_MODE` is set; nothing is recorded otherwise.

- `kibi usage-metrics` / `kb_check` telemetry acceptance: new metric `lookup_before_first_edit` (threshold `>=` policy `lookupBeforeFirstEditMinimum`, default 1) with evidence `unguidedEditPaths` and `lookupOperations`. It is `not_applicable` when no host hook recorded a requirement-linked edit, so logs without hook rows are judged as before. A failed metric adds the advisory diagnostic `lookup_before_first_edit_bypassed` (rank 35).
- `kibi usage-remediation`: one event item per session whose first linked edit had no earlier lookup, pointing at that hook row.
- `parseTelemetryUsageLog` still returns only Kibi operation rows; hook rows stay attached to the returned array (read them with `partitionTelemetryUsage`). Remediation `logLine` values now count hook rows and blank lines, so they match the file.
- `kibi-agent-core/hook-usage-log`: shared `appendHookUsage` / `appendHookUsageRows`, `kbUsageTrace` and `editTraces`. Hook rows (`interface: "hook"`) carry `host`, `session_id`, `hook_action` (`kb_usage` or `edited`), `kb_operation`, `path`, `path_kind` and `requirement_ids`. `hostKbOperation` recognizes MCP tool names and `kibi <route>` shell commands; `extractEditedPaths` reads `apply_patch` headers.
- Claude Code: `edited` rows now carry the file's `requirement_ids`, and every row names its `host`. Cursor (`postToolUse`), Codex and ZCode (`PostToolUse`) and OpenCode (`tool.execute.after`) now write the same `kb_usage` and `edited` rows.
