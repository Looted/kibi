Bootstrap no longer learns only from the code. The agent now starts with a short interview: it asks where product intent already lives (issue trackers such as Jira or YouTrack, wikis, specs, decision logs), which sources are authoritative or stale, and reads them through its own connectors. The bootstrap plan records those sources and the intent claims harvested from them, so each requirement taken from a ticket or page cites it and the citation is part of the approved plan hash. Kibi still never contacts those sources itself.

- feat(cli): `kb_plan_bootstrap` / `plan-bootstrap` accept `bootstrapContext.knowledgeSources` (id, kind, title, locator, authority, optional connector) and `bootstrapContext.intentClaims` (statement, sourceId, reference, optional excerpt). Both are normalized into `declaredContext` and bound into `planHash`. Grounded claims from authoritative or supporting sources become `req` candidates with `sourceKind: intent_claim`, citation evidence, and `text_ref: <sourceId>:<reference>`. Ungroundable claims become authoring follow-ups, stale sources are suppressed with `stale_knowledge_source`, and claims citing undeclared sources are reported as non-blocking diagnostics. A `needs_context` plan without declared sources asks for them.
- feat(skills): `kibi-bootstrap` 3.1.0 leads with the source interview before planning; the MCP `/kibi-bootstrap` prompt and the Cursor and ZCode commands follow it.
- docs: README, landing page, quick start, and install guide lead with a copy-paste agent setup prompt; manual installation moves behind a toggle.
